To do:
sort indecies method
^ auto = ^(
sort division method
5( = 5*(
change everything to doubles - the challenge will be . as a number, although can just do digit and point lol
add a sqrt button = ^(0.5), might have to use different brackets??
"-x" = to.String(int x * (-1))


Tests:
(5+5(9+61)+45)4(6+6)4
5+5+5(5+5*(5+7))
(5+5)+(5)
5--5

Done:
-- = +
use the last entered number as it is - make it so it asumes the last number entered is as it is

Thoughts:
22.08.20 - so ints can be negative so bascially need to check if a negative before a number to save the number as a negative 
so now instead of having two list i only need one, one list of strings
so biuld this string list with bits is the first job

21.08.20:
            //use arrays to calculate
            //(_numbers, _simOpps) = Calculation('(', _numbers, _simOpps) //needs to do all below for within)
            // to use brackets would be applying this order to inbetween brackets
            //for brakets inside brackets it needs a serach for ) ting, 
            // then can send it throug but need to how to correct
